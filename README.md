<h1>dahlia</h1>
annaxiom's little editor experiment
</div>

# Introduction
dahlia is a simple code editor designed to blend the minimalist elements of terminal-based editors (like Vim and Kakoune), with the familiarity of GUI editors (like VSCode).

## But why?
Because I can? dahlia isn't trying to compete against other bigger editors, it's just a litle project.

# Todo / Roadmap
- [x] Editor view
- [x] Data-drived command system
- [ ] Editor tabs
- [ ] Extensions / user themes
- [ ] LSP integration (?)
- [ ] an actually good UI
